SCP-087-B Remix
==============================

Welcome to my remixed version of SCP-087-B! A remix of SCP 087 B that adds new features like running and crouching!

What's New in This Remix
------------------------

-   Advanced Movement: New crouching and sprinting mechanics for more dynamic gameplay

How to Survive
--------------

### Basic Controls

-   WASD/Arrow Keys: Movement
-   Mouse: Look around
-   CTRL: Crouch
-   SHIFT: Sprint

### Survival Tips

1.  Use Crouching Strategically: Some entities can't detect you when crouched. If you hear or see something dangerous, try crouching immediately.

2.  When you hear "Don't look at me", don't trust him and look at him!

3.  Listen Carefully: Sound cues often warn you of dangers. Different footsteps, breathing, and roars indicate different threats.

4.  Watch for Signs: Floor numbers may provide hints - unusual floor numbers or symbols often indicate special floors.

5.  Be Cautious Around Corners: Enemies often lurk just out of sight, ready to appear when you reach certain positions.

Technical Notes
---------------

-   Adjust brightness in options.ini if needed
-   The game uses randomized events, so each playthrough is different
-   Some entities become more aggressive after floor 130
-   You can modify the frame limit in options.ini for smoother performance

Good luck, and remember: in SCP-087, what you can't see is often more terrifying than what you can.

*"It's not about whether you die or not, it's about when you die."*
